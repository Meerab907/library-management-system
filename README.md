Library Management System (C++ – DSA Project)
Project Overview
This Library Management System is a C++ console application designed to demonstrate Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills. It uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient book management and a Queue for breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. The system supports adding, deleting, searching, and displaying books, while persisting data in a file (books.txt).
This project highlights algorithmic thinking, modular programming, and file handling, making it suitable for showcasing technical skills to recruiters.
 Key Features
Book Management: Add, delete, and search books using ISBN
Traversal Methods: In-order (sorted) and BFS (level-order) display
File Persistence: Automatically saves and loads book data from books.txt
Queue Implementation: Supports BFS traversal of BST
Input Validation & Error Handling: Ensures robust user interaction
 Data Structures & Algorithms
Binary Search Tree (BST): Efficient book insertion, search, and deletion
Queue: Used for BFS traversal of the BST
File Handling: Stores book data to persist between program runs
Technologies & Skills
Programming Language: C++
Core DSA Concepts: BST, Queue, Recursion, BFS, In-order Traversal
Techniques Applied: File I/O, Input Validation, Error Handling
Portfolio Skills Demonstrated: Algorithm implementation, modular coding, problem-solving
How to Run
Clone the repository
Open the project in a C++ IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or VS Code).
Compile and run main.cpp.
Follow the console menu to add, search, delete, and display books.
The program will automatically create books.txt in the project folder to save book data.
